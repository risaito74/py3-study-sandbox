# py3-study-sandbox 🏖️

This is my Python 3 study sandbox for learning and practicing small coding exercises.  
（このリポジトリは、Python 3 の学習や小規模なコーディング演習を行うためのサンドボックスです。）

Here, I store various test codes and experiments as part of my journey to improve my Python skills and prepare for the Python 3 Engineer Certification.  
（Python 3 エンジニア認定基礎試験の準備の一環として、さまざまなテストコードや実験を保存しています。）
