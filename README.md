# py3-study-sandbox üèñÔ∏è

This is my Python 3 study sandbox for learning and practicing small coding exercises.  
Here, I store various test codes and experiments as part of my journey to improve my Python skills and prepare for the Python 3 Engineer Certification.

The repository contains small, independent code samples focused on understanding Python fundamentals like functions, dictionaries, and more.  
Each file is designed to test and reinforce specific concepts.
